A 2D platformer game developed in Unity where goal is to reach end of levels and collect as many keys as you can.

P.S. Too many problems while using source tree :/

Problems caused because i wasn't selecting proper authentication

git cmd line is the best!

git branch new_branch
git checkout new_branch
git config --global push.default current
git commit
git push
